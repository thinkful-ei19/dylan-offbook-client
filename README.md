# Offbook App

Offbook is an application for theatre artists. In it's current state, Offbook is geared towards actors as a tool to help organize monologues. Actors can add monologues, entering the title, playwright and text and save it to their home. From there, actors can take notes and write comments on each monologue. Future features will allow actors to attach comments to specific lines of the text and add tags (comedy, drama, etc.) to each monologue.
